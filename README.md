# Nuxt 4 Minimal Starter

Minimal, practical starter for exploring Nuxt 4. This repo contains a small, opinionated setup so curious developers can see how Nuxt 4 and Tailwind CSS fit together.

## What you'll find

- Minimal file structure with page-based routing.
- Tailwind CSS preconfigured for styling.
- ESLint for code style and safety.


## Code Style & Linting

This project uses **ESLint** for code style and linting. Make sure your IDE/editor is configured to use ESLint for formatting and linting. Most editors (VS Code, WebStorm, etc.) have ESLint integration or plugins available. This ensures consistent code style and helps catch errors early.

## Build & Local development

### Local install

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# run it like it's hot at localhost:3000
npm run dev

# expose network for testing on other devices
npm run dev -- --host
```
